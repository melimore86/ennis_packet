In this repository are the publications that Bill Pine woulld like Brad to reivew (publications_to_review folder), workflow documentation that the LCR project specifically uses (workflow_documentation folder), and links to review Github/Git (links.txt). In the reports folder there is an example NFWF quaterly report (spring2020_report.docx and July 2019quarterly Suwannee Sound NFWF draft.docx), and a data synthesis report specifically for the LCR project (Report.docx).  
  
Update: Recently added the protocol and duties folder including some information requested to add by Peter Frederick. In the duties folder are the wq and spat protocols. In the duties folder are some examples of the duties that Steve Beck was responsible for.  
  
For the publications to review most are related to the LCR project in some way. The Yenni et al., 2018 is a framework for the "living data" paper in my thesis (Mel M).
